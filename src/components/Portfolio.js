Our main project was a a fintech product for massive management of discounts for prompt payment through a web page that optimizes the invoice negotiation processes.</p>
                    <p className="projectText-body">My participation in the project was from the ideation, definition of the problem and research to validation with users, going through the design of the architecture and the data model. For the UX/UI design we mainly used Figma to build the prototype in order to be able to make early tests with stakeholders. For the frontend we used Nuxt.js, a framework based on Vue.js. </p>
